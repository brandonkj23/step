        <p> 
            I am a sophmore computer science major at Morhouse house college
            from Grovetown Georgia. Currently I am working as a STEP intern
            for google.

        <h3><center>Background</center></h3>
        <p>
            I was born in Florida, on May 23, 2001. My father joined the army,
            so we had to move around alot. What got me into computer science was
            the class I took in Highschool. Before that I did not know what major
            I wanted to go into, but after during the class I felt it fit the best.
